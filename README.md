## (For WiFi Pineapple NANO/TETRA *v2.6.0 or above*)

Here you will find ALOT of different tools (both binaries and installation-packages) that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT running on the WiFi Pineapple MK6 (NANO/TETRA), and the latest MK7 (Hak5 firmwares)  
Packages for the older firmwares can be found at the **[packages-15.05_mkvi](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-15.05_mkvi)** branch of this repo, which will also continue on getting updates!  
The latest branch is for the Pineapple MK7, and can be found here **[packages-19.07_mkvii](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-19.07_mkvii)**
