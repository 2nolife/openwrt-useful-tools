# OpenWRT 19.07 - Useful Tools 

## (For WiFi Pineapples *v2.6.0 or above*)
---
Here you will find ALOT of different tools (both binaries and installation-packages) that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT (Hak5 firmwares)  
Packages for the older firmwares can be found at the **[packages-15.05](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-15.05)** branch of this repo, which will also continue on getting updates!

#### Donations:
Are very much appreciated!  
Alot of my spare-time goes to keeping software up-to-date with the Pineapples, and helping out the community in general!  
It really helps me so i can continue on with this work. :)
