# OpenWRT 15.05 - Useful Tools 

## (For WiFi Pineapples *v2.5.4 or below*)
---
Here you will find ALOT of different tools (both binaries and installation-packages) that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT (Hak5 firmwares)  
Packages for the newer firmware can be found at the **[packages-19.07](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-19.07)** branch of this repo.
