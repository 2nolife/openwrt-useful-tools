# Useful Tools - OpenWRT 19.07 (WiFi Pineapples)

This branch of the repo contains different tools (both binaries and installation-packages) that i consider useful.  
There are now seperate branches for different versionf of OpenWRT.  
Packages for the older firmwares can still be located at the packages-15.05 branch of this repo!

If you want to make your Pineapple automatically get updates through opkg from my own repo. you can add the lines below to /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
