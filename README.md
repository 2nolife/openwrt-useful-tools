# OpenWRT 19.07 - Useful Tools (MK7)

## (For WiFi Pineapple MK7 *v2.7.0 or above*)
---
Here you will find ALOT of different tools (both binaries and installation-packages) that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT (Hak5 firmwares)  
Packages for the older firmwares can be found at the **[packages-15.05](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-15.05)** branch of this repo, which will also continue on getting updates!
